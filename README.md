# Simple-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model. Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. One variable, the predictor, is used to predict the value of another variable, the response.
